                I know what youre thinking. Is this really an E-commerce page? Well in all honesty Im not really sure on that however what I can assure you of is the undeiniable fact that i am actually trying. Yes its not much. However its something! It might not be the E-commerce page you expected and it will never be. For now though this is what I came up with.
